        <h2 class="heading">about me</h2>
        <p>I am a product manager and software engineer who thrives at the intersection of ideas and people. 
          I earned my MBA at Johns Hopkins University <a href="https://carey.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Carey Business School</a> and my BA at <a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/" target="_blank">Wellesley College</a>, and currently work at the technology consulting firm <a href="https://www.boozallen.com/" target="_blank">Booz Allen Hamilton</a> in Washington, DC. 
          I have helped design and built platforms and prototypes for government agencies like the VA, the NIH, and 
          <a href="https://www.benefits.gov/" target="_blank">DOL</a> - to name a few - and commercial products such as <a href="https://www.boozallen.com/e/media/press-release/booz-allen-launches-sailfish-platform.html" target="_blank">Sailfish</a> and 
          <a href="https://www.boozallen.com/s/product/district-defend.html#demo" target="_blank">District Defend</a>. In a previous life, I wrote copy and edited articles for a small educational nonprofit and various publications.</p>

          <p>
            Aside from doing work that I love, I enjoy: doing puzzles like the NYT daily mini crossword puzzle; practicing yoga; gardening; cooking; and the perennial profile "spare time activity," *traveling.

          <small>*I've relished the traveling and living abroad I've been fortunate to do and I hope to do some safe (non pandemic) travel again soon.</small>
          <small>^These publications or parent organizations have evolved and no longer host this piece online</small><br>
          <small>*JPost left the byline as my former boss's name since the blog series was his, but I wrote this post</small>
          <small>There's an easter egg on here. Did you find it?! If you think you did, msg me with the details and I will get back to you :)</small>
