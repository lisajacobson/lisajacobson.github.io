        <h2 class="heading">about me</h2>
        <p>I am a digital consultant and former software engineer who thrives at the intersection of ideas and people. 
          I earned my MBA at Johns Hopkins University <a href="https://carey.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Carey Business School</a> and my BA at <a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/" target="_blank">Wellesley College</a>, and currently work as a Lead Technologist at the technology consulting firm <a href="https://www.boozallen.com/" target="_blank">Booz Allen Hamilton</a> based in Washington, DC. 
          I designed and built a range digital products and platforms as a front end web developer for the first part of my career; and more recently have led teams and work to bring an agile approach to all sorts of IT projects from R&D prototypes to complex mission-critical systems. Today I practice product management in service of federal government missions. In a previous life, I wrote copy and edited articles for a small educational nonprofit.</p>

          <p>
            When I'm not working I like to read historical fiction, exercise, grow plants/herbs, cook, travel (near and far), and take photos.
